# MyeloidResponseScore

This repository stores the data and R codes used in our study, linked to the paper entitled "A Simple Signature Reveals the Myeloid Contexture and Predicts the Prognosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma".

This repository includes five folders, within each are the R code file and raw data used in that section. 

1. MRS construction with lasso: the R codes and the data used to establish the Myeloid Response Score (MRS), related to Fig1C in the paper;
2. ROC analysis of MRS in cohorts: the R codes and the data used for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis that determines the discriminatory ability of the MRS in different cohorts of HCC patients, related to Fig1, Fig2, and FigS11 in the paper;
3. Gene expression microarray analysis: the gene expression microarray data of 21 HCC samples and the R codes used for analysis. These data are related to Fig4, FigS18, and FigS19A in the paper;
4. TCGA-Monocle: the RNA-seq data downloaded from the TCGA-LIHC project and the R codes used for analysis. These data are related to Fig5 in the paper;
5. Nomogram construction: the R codes and the data used to build the nomograms, related to Fig6 in the paper.
